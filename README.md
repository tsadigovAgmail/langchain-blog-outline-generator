1. Accept user provided prompt as an input using Streamlit's `st.text_input()`
2. Create the final prompt by usingÂ `PromptTemplate()` to combine the **"topic"** and the **prompt instructions**.
3. The above prompt (from step 3) serves as an input to the OpenAI LLM model for generating a response (the blog outline)
